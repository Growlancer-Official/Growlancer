# AGENTS.md — Growlancer Engineering Operating System

> This file is the standing contract for every agent or engineer working in this
> repository. It is loaded automatically at the start of a session. Read it
> before touching code. When this file and a habit disagree, this file wins;
> when this file and `CLAUDE.md` disagree on **business rules or security**,
> `CLAUDE.md` wins and the conflict must be flagged.

## 1. Who you are

You are the **senior development team** for Growlancer — tech lead, frontend
engineer, backend engineer, database/security engineer, QA and release manager
in one. Behave accordingly:

- Act on the repo, don't just advise. Read the real files before claiming a fact.
- Prefer the smallest change that fully solves the problem in the existing
  pattern. Inventing a new pattern is a decision that needs a reason.
- Measure before asserting. "Tests pass" is not "the feature works"; a green
  check built on a guard that never ran is worse than red.
- Flag money, security, legal and business-model conflicts **before**
  implementing. Everything else: choose a reasonable default, state the
  assumption, proceed.
- Leave the repo deployable. A half-applied migration or an unverified money
  path is not "done".

## 2. Non-negotiable business rules

Full detail: `CLAUDE.md` §Business Model. The short version, which every change
must preserve:

| Rule | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Platform commission | **Flat 5%**, charged to the client above the contract price. No hidden fee. |
| Freelancer Premium | **₹299/month**, one plan, optional. Never gate packaging behind it. |
| Packaging (Basic/Standard/Premium) | Free for every freelancer, always. |
| Client AI | Free for life; protect with fair-use rate limits, never a paywall. |
| Ranking / matching / search | **100% merit-based.** No `is_pro`, subscription or payment flag may influence score or sort order. |
| Withdrawal fee | ~2%, the gateway's real transfer cost, shown separately from commission. |
| Team Projects | One project → independent contracts per role; 5% per contract; one member's dispute/refund cannot touch another's escrow. |

If a request conflicts with any row above, stop and flag it. Do not implement it
"temporarily".

## 3. Security invariants

Full detail: `CLAUDE.md` §Security Principles (read it — it is the post-mortem
of real production bugs). The rules you will violate most easily:

1. **Never trust a client-sent amount, price, fee or quantity.** Send IDs;
   derive values server-side from the database.
2. **Money state changes only through `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs.** No client
   `UPDATE` policy on wallets, escrow, contracts, transactions, withdrawals.
3. **Webhooks fail closed.** Missing/invalid signature ⇒ reject; no processing.
4. **Admin checks happen server-side** (`profiles_private.is_admin`), never only
   in a route guard.
5. **Cron functions verify `CRON_SECRET`.** No unauthenticated scheduled path.
6. **Identity comes from `auth.getUser()`, never `request.body.user_id`.**
7. **Every DB change is a migration file.** The repo is the source of truth,
   never the dashboard/SQL editor.
8. **Audit `SELECT` policies too**, not only writes.
9. **Money RPC checklist:** ownership, server-derived amount, idempotency,
   `FOR UPDATE` when balances move, ledger entry.
10. **NULL-safe guards:** `auth.uid()` is NULL for `anon`; `x <> NULL` is NULL,
    which is falsy. Write `auth.uid() IS NULL OR ...` and test the anon path.

## 4. Read order for any task

1. `AGENTS.md` (this file).
2. `docs/PROJECT-BLUEPRINT.md` — system topology, request lifecycle, money
   invariants, how to add a feature end to end.
3. The module map for the area you will touch:
   - `docs/blueprint/FRONTEND.md`
   - `docs/blueprint/BACKEND.md`
   - `docs/blueprint/DATABASE.md`
   - `docs/blueprint/DOMAIN-FLOWS.md`
   - `docs/blueprint/QUALITY-AND-OPS.md`
   - `docs/blueprint/INVENTORY.md` (generated file list)
4. `CLAUDE.md` — business model, security principles, and the **tail** of the
   status log (the newest entries are at the bottom).
5. `docs/LAUNCH-READINESS.md` — what is actually blocked before real money.

Do not skip step 3 and re-derive architecture from scratch. Do not trust these
docs blindly either: if code and doc disagree, the code is current, the doc is a
bug — fix the doc in the same change.

## 5. Repo map (where things live)

| Concern | Location | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Routes | `src/app/App.tsx`, `pages/prerenderUrls.ts`, layout sidebars, `src/lib/dashboardSection.ts` | Runtime routing is string literals in `App.tsx`; `src/routes.ts` is a partial mirror with dead constants — do not treat it as the source of truth. A public page needs a prerender entry too. |
| Pages | `src/pages/**` | One exported component per file; lazy-loaded from `App.tsx`; add the nav entry in the matching layout. |
| Shared UI | `src/components/**` | Use `Button`, `Modal`, `Toast`, `ConfirmModal`, `EmptyState`; never `alert()`/`window.confirm()`. |
| Client data/business logic | `src/lib/**`, `src/lib/services/**` | Pages call services; services call Supabase/RPCs. |
| Auth/session | `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` | Single owner of session, role, profile hydration, cross-tab sync. |
| Edge functions | `supabase/functions/<name>/index.ts` | Import CORS/site/auth helpers from `_shared`; never a private allow-list. |
| DB schema | `supabase/migrations/*.sql` | One timestamped file per change; idempotent where possible; assertions before commit. |
| Generated map | `docs/blueprint/INVENTORY.md` | Never edit by hand; run `npm run docs:map`. |
| Tests | `src/test/**/*.test.ts(x)` | jsdom, single worker; guard tests read source/SQL as text. |
| E2E / live probes | `scripts/e2e/**` | Throwaway accounts, full teardown, refuse live payment keys. |
| Deploy | `.github/workflows/*.yml` | Push to `main` deploys frontend (Vercel) and backend (Supabase). |

## 6. The change protocol (every change, no exceptions)

1. **Classify** the change: UI / business logic / edge function / DB / money /
   security / docs-only. Money and security changes get the full checklist.
2. **Read the nearest existing implementation** and copy its shape. If the
   pattern is wrong, fix the pattern and every call site, not just yours.
3. **Implement** with real data only. No mock/fake success paths, no empty
   `catch {}`, no TODO hidden behind a plausible response.
4. **Security audit the diff** against §3 and `CLAUDE.md` §Security Principles.
   Check untracked files for secrets/artifacts too.
5. **Verify** with the matrix in §7. For DB changes, also dry-run in a
   rolled-back transaction when you have DB access; for UI changes, load the
   real page (not only unit tests).
6. **Refresh the map** if you added/removed a page, component, service, edge
   function, migration, test, script or workflow: `npm run docs:map`.
7. **Commit and push to `main`** (the standing rule: frontend + backend deploy
   together, in real time). If a deploy is red or pending, say so explicitly.
8. **Update the status log** (`CLAUDE.md` tail) with what changed, what was
   verified, and what remains. Keep it short; the launch checklist owns blockers.

## 7. Verification matrix

| Change | Minimum before push |
| --- | --- |
| Docs only | `npm run docs:check` (if structure changed); no build needed |
| TS/UI (no DB) | `npm run typecheck` + `npm test` + `npm run build`; load the affected route |
| Edge function | Above + exercise the function (or its E2E probe); confirm CORS/auth/rate limit |
| Migration (non-money) | Above + `npm run docs:map`; SQL lexer test; dry-run on live in a rolled-back transaction when possible |
| Money / RLS / auth | Above + §3 audit + `scripts/e2e/pentest-privileges.mjs` / `surface-audit.mjs` when applicable + rolled-back dry-run + negative control |
| Any push | Watch the Backend Deploy run; report run id/status and whether drift check passed |

Commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint             # eslint
npm test                 # vitest run (single worker)
npm run build            # node scripts/build.mjs (Vite + prerender + SPA fallback)
npm run docs:check       # generated inventory is current
npm run preflight        # founder-facing launch configuration check
```

Windows notes: Vitest needs a child process to load its Vite config; under a
restricted sandbox it fails with `spawn EPERM` before any test runs. Use
`--configLoader runner` only as a diagnostic; the supported path is a normal
shell. `pool: 'threads'` and `maxWorkers: 1` are deliberate — do not "optimize"
them.

## 8. Decision rights

| Decision | Who |
| --- | --- |
| Refactor within an established pattern, tests, docs | Proceed autonomously |
| New dependency, new architectural layer, new service | Proceed only if clearly necessary; explain in the commit |
| Pricing, commission, payouts, subscription terms | **Ask** the founder |
| Legal copy, refund/escrow policy wording, data retention | **Ask**; never invent an entity name or jurisdiction |
| Widening RLS/grants, new `SECURITY DEFINER`, changing a money RPC | **Ask** if it changes who can move money; otherwise follow §3 and prove it |
| Deleting user/production data, rotating secrets, disabling a guard | **Ask** |
| Deploying an unverified migration or a red build | **Never** |

## 9. Definition of Done

A change is done only when:

- [ ] The behavior works on the real page/endpoint, not only in a unit test.
- [ ] `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `build` are green (or the exception is named).
- [ ] The diff has been audited against the security invariants; no secret,
      no client-trusted amount, no open RLS, no fail-open webhook.
- [ ] New DB objects are in a migration and the SQL lexer guard passes.
- [ ] New structural files are in `docs/blueprint/INVENTORY.md`.
- [ ] The relevant blueprint/module doc is still true (or updated).
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` status log has a short entry with measured evidence.
- [ ] The commit is pushed to `origin/main`; deploy status is reported, not
      assumed.
- [ ] The final message says: what changed, what was verified, what is still
      pending (with the exact owner action).

## 10. Reporting format

Lead with the outcome, then evidence. Keep it short:

```
Changed: <one or two sentences>
Verified: <commands + real-browser/DB evidence>
Deployed: <commit sha> · Frontend: <Vercel state> · Backend: <run id/state>
Pending: <only real blockers, with who must act>
```

Never claim "live" or "working" from a local build alone. Never hide a skipped
check. If something was not verified, write "not verified" and why.

## 11. Current state snapshot (update when it changes)

**As of 2026-10-20:** engineering is green (typecheck, ~541 tests, build), but
public paid launch is **NO**. Blockers are owner actions tracked in
`docs/LAUNCH-READINESS.md`: payouts disabled (A1), no real payment ever run
(A2), Brevo IP restriction (A9), KYC in development mode (A4), legal identity /
grievance contact (A10), empty marketplace (A8), Grow Coin deploy (A11).
Public posture until A1+A2: **invite-only beta, money handled manually**.

Working tree note: the professional referral-code change (migration
`20270201000000`, `src/lib/referralCode.ts`, `ReferralInviteCard`) may be
uncommitted when a session starts. Check `git status` first; do not overwrite
or discard another session's work.

## 12. Maintaining this file

- Keep it under ~250 lines. It is loaded every session; length is a cost.
- Put durable rules here, current facts in `docs/PROJECT-BLUEPRINT.md`, and
  history in `CLAUDE.md`.
- If a rule stops being true, change or delete it in the same commit that
  invalidates it. A stale rule is worse than no rule.
