The codebase is organized to keep presentation, shared application logic, services, infrastructure configuration, and database changes independently maintainable.

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Ensure the development environment includes:

* **Node.js 18+**
* **npm**
* **Git**
* **Supabase CLI**, where required for database and Edge Function development

Verify the environment:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

---

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Growlancer-Official/Growlancer.git
```

```bash
cd Growlancer
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Use the local development URL provided by Vite after startup.

---

# 🔐 Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY=
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=
```

### Security Requirements

Never commit:

* Production secrets
* API credentials
* Supabase service-role keys
* Payment secrets
* Private signing keys
* Authentication credentials
* Sensitive environment configuration

Use environment-specific configuration for development and production.

---

# 🧪 Development & Validation

Before submitting a change, run the relevant project validation commands.

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Build Validation

```bash
npm run build:check
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Changes affecting authentication, authorization, payments, database structure, security controls, or core marketplace workflows should receive additional review.

---
