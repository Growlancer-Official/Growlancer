## 0b. Latest pass (2026-10-28) — what was verified and changed

Local quality gate re-run against the current tree; every number below is from
this pass, not carried over:

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | `npm run typecheck` | **PASS** — exit 0, 0 diagnostics |
| ESLint | `npm run lint` | **PASS** — exit 0, 0 findings |
| Unit + contract | `npm test` | **PASS** — 65 files, 762/762 tests |
| Focused money/security suite | `npm test -- commissionAndPaymentSecurity serverOnlyRpcs sqlMigrationSyntax serviceRoleContextGuard` | **PASS** — 61/61 |
| MVP scope invariants | `npm run test:mvp-scope` | **PASS** — 12/12 |
| Docs inventory | `npm run docs:check` | **PASS** — inventory current (683 files) |
| Production build | `npm run build` | **PASS** — 45.3 s; dist validated, no 404.html |
| Secrets in fresh `dist/` | grep for `service_role` / JWT-shaped literals | **PASS** — no hits |
| Full diff review | `git diff` over all 8 files | **PASS** — no secrets, debug code or unrelated changes |
| Local Supabase (DB/RLS/RPC live) | `supabase status` | **BLOCKED** — no Docker/Podman; CLI linked to hosted project (production). No local stack was started, no production data touched. |
| Razorpay test-mode payment / payout | — | **BLOCKED** — no test keys / `RAZORPAY_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` absent |
| OAuth E2E (GitHub/LinkedIn) | — | **BLOCKED** — needs real provider accounts |

What changed in this pass (all uncommitted, on top of `9869163`):

1. **Withdrawal finalization boundary** — `process_withdrawal_complete` /
   `process_withdrawal_failure` previously trusted a browser-reachable
   `auth.uid()` check (and rejected the service-role caller that has no
   `auth.uid()`), so a client could mark its own pending withdrawal complete
   while the real payout path silently failed. The new migration
   (`20270206000000_secure_withdrawal_finalization.sql`) makes both RPCs
   service-role-only, locks rows `FOR UPDATE`, updates wallet + withdrawal +
   transaction atomically, is idempotent on same-state retries, and now also
   **rejects conflicting terminal transitions** (a failed withdrawal cannot be
   completed; a completed one cannot be refunded) — asserted inside the
   migration itself. Edge functions (`withdrawal`, `razorpay-payout-webhook`)
   now call these RPCs and **fail closed with `reconciliation_required: true`
   instead of reporting success when finalization fails**; the old
   best-effort `release_wallet_funds` rollback on webhook failure is gone.
2. **Rate limiting on money endpoints** — `razorpay`, `paypal` and
   `withdrawal` now use the atomic server-only `increment_rate_limit` RPC
   (single UPSERT with `count = count + 1 RETURNING`) instead of a read-then-
   insert race that could reset the counter, and the withdrawal path no longer
   **fails open** (`if (error) return true`) when the limiter is unavailable.
3. Regression tests added (24→61 focused) pinning revokes, `FOR UPDATE`
   locking, terminal-state guards, no-local-refund-after-acceptance, and the
   atomic limiter in each money function.

---

## 1. Verdict

**Growlanzo is not launch-ready yet.** It is materially closer than it was:
five confirmed security defects are closed and guarded by tests, the deferred
modules now fail closed at the API instead of leaking data, and the full local
quality gate is green.

What is still missing is not code — it is **evidence from a staging
environment**: the payment-in journey, payouts, email delivery, RLS on live
policies, and the two browser journeys. Those are BLOCKED here because this
workspace has no staging URL, no E2E accounts and no provider sandbox keys.

Two product decisions also need the founder before launch (§5).

**Genuine launch blockers as of 2026-10-28** (nothing here is code-closed):

1. The new withdrawal-finalization migration must be **applied to the hosted
   database** through the normal drift-check → `supabase db push` pipeline.
   Until it lands, the old browser-reachable finalizers are still live.
2. RazorpayX Payouts must be enabled and `RAZORPAY_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` set, or
   withdrawals stay in the "queued / not configured" path by design.
3. One real test-mode payment + webhook replay must be executed in an
   isolated environment (no test keys here — see §2/§0b).
4. Authenticated client/freelancer E2E needs disposable accounts on a
   non-production database (Docker unavailable; the linked Supabase project is
   production).
5. Legal entity / grievance-contact wording must be confirmed by the founder
   (see `docs/LAUNCH-READINESS.md` §A10); not verifiable from code.

**Honest verdict: NOT READY for production. READY AFTER LISTED EXTERNAL
STEPS** once blockers 1–4 are executed on a staging environment and evidenced.

---

## 2. What was verified in this pass

(The 2026-10-28 pass is §0b above; the table below records the 2026-10-21 pass
for history. Both agree on the BLOCKED items.)

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit` | **PASS** — exit 0, no errors |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | **PASS** — exit 0, no warnings |
| Unit + integration | `npm test` | **PASS** — 51 files, 602 tests |
| Scope guard (new) | `npm run test:mvp-scope` | **PASS** — 8/8 invariants |
| Production build | `npm run build` | **PASS** — 61.1 s, dist validated |
| Built-artifact check | grep of `dist/{internships,careers,certificate,verify-certificate}/index.html` | **PASS** — each prerendered page contains the unavailable copy |
| Browser E2E | `node scripts/e2e/auth-lifecycle.mjs --base=…` | **BLOCKED** — harness now runs and fails closed: *"missing SUPABASE_URL / VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, E2E_FREELANCER_EMAIL/PASSWORD, E2E_CLIENT_EMAIL/PASSWORD. Refusing to exit 0"* |
| Staging RLS / grants | — | **BLOCKED** — no staging project credentials in this workspace |
| Razorpay test-mode payment-in | — | **BLOCKED** — no test-mode keys; not simulated on purpose |
| Payout sandbox | — | **BLOCKED** — provider setup incomplete, per the previous review |
| Email delivery (Brevo) | — | **BLOCKED** — no test inbox configured |
| Dependency audit (`npm audit`) | — | **NOT RUN** — registry install took >3 min and was abandoned; not claimed as clean |
| Edge-function typecheck | `deno check` | **NOT RUN** — Deno is not installed in this workspace. The function changes are covered by the static guard tests only |

The two build artefacts that matter were checked as artefacts, not inferred from
a green exit code: the prerendered HTML for `/internships`, `/careers`,
`/certificate` and `/verify-certificate` each contains
*"not part of the early-access release"*, and `/contests` does not.

For the E2E line specifically: `playwright-core` was declared in
`devDependencies` but missing from `node_modules`. It was installed with
`--no-save --no-package-lock`, so `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are
unchanged. The harness then ran and refused to exit 0 without staging config —
which is the correct behaviour, and the exact opposite of the skipped-guardrail
failure this repo has hit before.

---

## 3. Security findings from the previous review

| # | Finding | Status now | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | Public certificate/QR verification returned full certificate records + internship applicant rows | **FIXED** | `admin-data` returns `410` with `available:false` and reads no row. Guard test asserts the branch contains no `.from(`, `.select(`, `internship_applications` or raw token |
| B | Subscription cron charged saved cards without the `subscription_billing_charges` idempotency ledger | **MITIGATED (not eliminated)** | Cron now returns `503 {charged:false}` before any gateway call unless `FEATURE_SUBSCRIPTION_BILLING_ENABLED=true`. **The missing ledger use is still latent** and must be fixed before billing is ever re-enabled |
| C | KYC could auto-verify via a development adapter | **FIXED** | DB `mode='development'` is downgraded to `production` unless `KYC_DEV_MODE_ALLOWED=true`; the auto-verify adapter is unreachable without it, and an unconfigured provider resolves to `review` |
| D | Internship application updated from an email address alone | **FIXED (by closure)** | The whole function answers `410`; the reapply-by-email path cannot run. Historical rows preserved |
| E | `paypal-webhook` called `getCorsHeaders` without importing it | **FIXED** | Import added. Every request — including OPTIONS — previously died with `ReferenceError` before signature verification. A repo-wide test now fails if any function calls it without importing it |
| F | `admin_credentials` had a PUBLIC-scoped RLS policy and was in the Realtime publication | **FIXED IN MIGRATION, UNVERIFIED LIVE** | `20270127000000_fix_admin_credentials_rls_and_realtime.sql` drops the PUBLIC policy, re-scopes to `authenticated` + `is_admin_user`, and unpublishes the table. **A migration existing is not a policy being deployed** — staging check required (§4) |
| G | NULL-auth guards on money RPCs | **FIXED IN MIGRATION, UNVERIFIED LIVE** | `20270130000000_restore_null_safe_money_guards.sql` rejects `auth.uid() IS NULL`, checks ownership, and self-asserts the guard is present |
| H | Payment-in, payouts, email never proven | **BLOCKED** | See §2 |

### Why B is "mitigated", not "fixed"

Disabling the cron removes the risk but leaves the defect. If billing is turned
back on without an idempotency insert on `(subscription_id, billing_period)`,
a re-run (retry, double cron, manual invoke) can charge twice. That is now a
documented precondition for re-enabling, not a launch blocker, because billing
ships off.

---

## 4. Staging verification still required (cannot be done here)

These are the checks that turn "fixed in the repo" into "fixed in production":

1. `admin_credentials`: `SELECT` as `anon` returns nothing; as a non-admin
   `authenticated` user returns nothing; as an admin returns rows.
2. `profiles_private`, `wallets`, `escrow`, `transactions`, `withdrawals`:
   confirm no client `INSERT/UPDATE` policy; confirm anon gets nothing.
3. Every money RPC: anonymous call rejected; cross-user call rejected;
   duplicate call idempotent.
4. `kyc-submit` with `mode='development'` and no opt-in → row ends `review`.
5. Billing cron with `CRON_SECRET` → `503 charged:false`, and
   `subscription_billing_charges` row count unchanged.
6. Certificate/internship/QR endpoints → `410`, no `certificate`, `token` or
   applicant field in the body.
7. Razorpay test-mode: order → checkout → webhook → ledger → escrow state;
   then replay the webhook and confirm no double ledger entry.

Each must be recorded with the command and the observed response. The plan and
rollback are in [STAGING-MIGRATION-AND-ROLLBACK.md](STAGING-MIGRATION-AND-ROLLBACK.md).

---

## 5. Decisions only the founder can make

1. **Premium / Grow Coins vs the launch brief.** The brief asked to defer
   Premium, subscriptions and the referral/reward programme. `AGENTS.md` §2 and
   `CLAUDE.md` make Freelancer Premium ₹299/month and merit-only ranking
   non-negotiable business rules. This release keeps the **one-off Premium
   purchase** and the **Grow Coin/referral programme** enabled, and defers the
   recurring billing cron (money risk), certificates, internships and in-house
   KYC (PII risk). Confirm this, or say which side wins — each flip is a
   one-line change in `_shared/features.ts`.
2. **Existing subscriptions.** If any live subscriber exists, billing is now
   paused for them. Someone must decide: honour paid access manually, notify
   them, or re-enable billing after the idempotency fix. Nothing is cancelled or
   downgraded automatically.
3. **Contests.** Not gated yet (no PII/money defect, but it is in the deferred
   list). Gate or keep — either is defensible; it needs a decision before the
   UI cleanup in the scope doc §3.

---

## 6. What changed in this pass

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `supabase/functions/_shared/features.ts` | **new** — fail-closed feature switch + `410` helper |
| `supabase/functions/admin-data/index.ts` | public certificate/QR verification route replaced with `410`; no row read |
| `supabase/functions/internship-applications/index.ts` | every method `410` before the first DB read |
| `supabase/functions/subscription-billing-cron/index.ts` | returns `503 charged:false` before any gateway call |
| `supabase/functions/kyc-submit/index.ts` | `KYC_DEV_MODE_ALLOWED` opt-in; DB dev-mode downgraded; adapter unreachable |
| `supabase/functions/paypal-webhook/index.ts` | missing `getCorsHeaders` import |
| `src/components/FeatureUnavailablePage.tsx` | **new** — honest unavailable screen (410 semantics in the UI) |
| `src/app/App.tsx` | internships, careers, certificate and verify-certificate routes gated |
| `src/test/mvpScopeGuard.test.ts` | **new** — 13 regression tests |
| `scripts/check-mvp-scope.mjs` | **new** — CLI scope guard |
| `package.json` | `test:mvp-scope` script |
| `docs/MVP-SCOPE-AND-E2E-TEST-PLAN.md` | **new** |
| `docs/STAGING-MIGRATION-AND-ROLLBACK.md` | **new** |
| `docs/blueprint/INVENTORY.md` | regenerated by `npm run docs:map` (derived) |

No database migration is part of the 2026-10-21 change set. That is what makes
the rollback a code rollback (§0 of the migration doc).

---

## 6b. What changed in this pass (2026-10-28, uncommitted on `9869163`)

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `supabase/migrations/20270206000000_secure_withdrawal_finalization.sql` | **new** — service-role-only, locked, idempotent `process_withdrawal_complete` / `process_withdrawal_failure`; rejects cross-terminal-state transitions; self-asserting privileges + body guards |
| `supabase/functions/withdrawal/index.ts` | finalizes through the atomic RPC; fails closed with `reconciliation_required` when local state cannot be saved after provider acceptance; no best-effort local rollback of accepted payouts; atomic `increment_rate_limit` limiter (was fail-open) |
| `supabase/functions/razorpay-payout-webhook/index.ts` | terminal statuses go through the RPCs (no separate `release_wallet_funds` + two updates); lookup errors surfaced; non-terminal updates guarded to `pending/processing` |
| `supabase/functions/razorpay/index.ts` | atomic `increment_rate_limit` (server-only) instead of read-then-insert race |
| `supabase/functions/paypal/index.ts` | same atomic limiter |
| `src/test/commissionAndPaymentSecurity.test.ts` | **+40 lines** — withdrawal-finalization contract tests (revokes, `FOR UPDATE`, terminal-state guards, no local refund after acceptance, limiter per money function) |
| `src/test/serverOnlyRpcs.test.ts` | walk skips `src/test/**` so a test-only literal is not mistaken for a browser call site |
| `docs/blueprint/INVENTORY.md` | regenerated (`npm run docs:map`) for the new migration — 683 files / 302 migrations |

**This pass DOES include a database migration.** Rollback is therefore a code
rollback **plus** leaving the new migration applied (it is additive and only
replaces two function bodies; it drops no data). Deployment follows the normal
`supabase db push --include-all` path in Backend Deploy; do not apply it by
hand from this workspace (the CLI is linked to production and Docker is absent).

---

## 7. Honest position on "ready for 1M users"

Seven test accounts are **not** traction, and passing local tests is **not**
capacity. Before a public launch at real volume, these remain unproven:

- **Database**: connection limits, index coverage on `projects`/`proposals`/
  `contracts`/`messages`, and query plans at realistic row counts. Not measured.
- **Realtime**: channel fan-out per workspace, and the cost of the
  `grow_coin_ledger` subscription per user.
- **Payments**: the happy path is untested end-to-end in sandbox; webhook replay
  behaviour is untested.
- **Abuse**: rate limits exist, but no load or brute-force test has been run.
- **Support**: the founder runbook exists; nobody has been through a real
  dispute yet.
- **Legal**: entity name, support contact and refund wording must match the
  actual operating entity — do not invent either.

The correct public statement today is **early access**, not "ready for a million
users". The code is closer than the evidence is; the next milestone is the
staging evidence in §4, not another feature.

---

## 8. Product pass — 2026-10-29 (referrals, AI support, premium tiers, light KYC)

Second pass on top of §0b. Everything below is **uncommitted** and sits on the
same `main` baseline; the local quality gate was re-run end to end afterwards.

### 8a. What changed

1. **Referral pays both sides, in real time** — a completed referral credited
   only the referrer. `supabase/migrations/20270207000000_referee_referral_bonus.sql`
   adds the referee award (10 coins, reason `referee_referral_bonus`) inside the
   same transaction and behind the same latches as the existing award: one
   ledger row per referee per referral (new partial unique index), the
   `bonus_claimed` latch plus a `FOR UPDATE` row lock, the real-engagement gate
   (verified provider, never dev-mode), the same-side role gate, soft fraud
   flags, the monthly cap and notifications. `grow_coin_ledger` is already in
   the realtime publication and `useGrowCoinBalance` subscribes to the user's
   own rows, so **both** balance pills move the moment the criteria completes.
2. **AI support actually works the ticket** — `ai-ticket-responder` now loads
   the stored conversation (`ticket_messages`, including `sender_type`) and
   answers with a ticket-aware prompt that must diagnose and give concrete steps
   rather than acknowledge. Replies are written through
   `append_ai_support_message` (migration `20270208000000_support_ai_message_sender.sql`:
   new `sender_type`, check constraint, service-role-only RPC), so the thread is
   continuous and the AI badge is truthful. The ticket page subscribes to the
   ticket + messages and renders user / AI / human bubbles live; the user marks
   a ticket resolved only after the fix works. Support surface is deliberately
   **AI in-app + email (`growlanzo.own@gmail.com`)**, with phone/live chat shown
   as *coming soon* on the contact page.
3. **Client navigation icons** — AI Matches now uses the AI sparkle (the glyph
   `ClientMatchesPage` already uses) instead of a talent-search icon, and Team
   Projects uses the group icon; the "Find Talent" shortcut to the match page
   follows the same glyph. Locked by `src/test/clientDashboardIcons.test.ts`.
4. **Premium tiers + advanced analytics** — `subscriptionHelpers` gains
   `isPremiumSubscription`; `subscription_plans` renames the canonical ₹299 row
   to **Pro** and seeds a **Premium** tier (migration
   `20270209000000_premium_analytics_tiers.sql`, idempotent, touches no existing
   subscription). Analytics stays **simple and free for every freelancer**; the
   advanced block (trend, funnel, category breakdown) renders only for Premium
   and flips on in real time through `useProStatus`'s subscription. The Premium
   page was rebuilt to show both tiers and to stay fully usable on mobile.
5. **Light KYC — name + email + phone, both roles** — the document/PAN/GST
   verification path is gone from the product surface. One shared screen
   (`pages/dashboard/IdentityVerificationPage.tsx`) serves
   `/dashboard/identity-verification` and `/client/verification`, with sidebar
   entries, the realtime "Verify Now" chip, and routing restored
   (`IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_ENABLED = true`). Criteria come from records only the
   user can change: saved full name, `auth.users.email_confirmed_at`, and
   `auth.users.phone_confirmed_at` via Supabase phone OTP. Migration
   `20270210000000_light_kyc_three_criteria.sql` adds
   `refresh_light_kyc(p_full_name)` — service/authenticated only, the **only**
   writer of `verification_status`, never downgrades an admin decision, and
   bypasses the self-modification trigger only inside the definer function.
   `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_ACTIONS` stays **false** on purpose (see 8c).

### 8b. Verification (this pass)

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit` | **PASS** — exit 0 |
| ESLint (changed files) | `npx eslint src/...` | **PASS** — exit 0 |
| Unit + contract | `npx vitest run` | **PASS** — 67 files, 804/804 tests |
| Dark-theme coverage | included above | **PASS** — 17/17 |
| Docs inventory | `npm run docs:check` | **PASS** — inventory current (306 migrations, 67 tests) |
| Production build | `npm run build` | **PASS** — 23.1 s, dist validated, no `404.html` |
| Migration SQL syntax | `sqlMigrationSyntax.test.ts` | **PASS** |
| Live DB apply | `supabase db push` | **BLOCKED** — CLI is linked to the production project and Docker is absent; migrations were **not** applied from here |
| Phone OTP end to end | — | **BLOCKED** — no SMS provider configured in the project |
| Referral payout / AI support live | — | **BLOCKED** — needs the functions deployed + two real accounts |

### 8c. Founder steps before these features are live

1. **Apply the five new migrations** with the normal Backend Deploy path
   (`supabase db push --include-all`), in order: `20270206000000`,
   `20270207000000`, `20270208000000`, `20270209000000`, `20270210000000`.
2. **Deploy the changed Edge Functions**: `ai-ticket-responder`, `withdrawal`,
   `razorpay`, `razorpay-webhook`, `razorpay-payout-webhook`, `paypal`.
3. **Turn on phone verification** (Supabase → Auth → Providers → Phone + an SMS
   provider such as Twilio; put the auth token in project secrets, never in the
   repo). Until then the KYC page verifies name + email and explains the phone
   step instead of pretending it passed.
4. **Only then** flip `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_ACTIONS` to `true` in
   `src/lib/featureFlags.ts` if unverified users should be blocked from orders,
   escrow and withdrawals. It is deliberately off so real money is not locked
   behind a provider that is not connected yet.
5. Keep **email support** as the human fallback until the phone/live-chat
   channels exist; the app labels them "coming soon" rather than implying they
   work.

### 8d. Rollback

Code rollback is safe for all five items. The migrations are additive: new
columns have defaults, the only destructive statement is a widened CHECK
constraint and a `subscription_plans` rename of the canonical ₹299 row, which is
idempotent and guarded by a `DO` block that does nothing when the row is absent.

### 8e. Deployment record — 2026-10-29 (production)

Everything in §8a is now **committed, pushed and deployed** to the live project.

| What | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Commits | `ce275c9` (feature set) → `644f7fd` (KYC column-grant fix), branch `main`, remote `Growlancer-Official/Growlanzo` |
| Frontend | Vercel Production deployment READY after each push; live `https://growlanzo.vercel.app` answers 200, deep route `/dashboard/identity-verification` answers 200, and the served chunk contains `refresh_light_kyc` + `phone_change` |
| Migrations | `db push` applied `20270209000000`, `20270210000000`, `20270211000000`; `migration list` shows local = remote through `20270211000000` |
| Edge Functions | `ai-ticket-responder`, `withdrawal`, `razorpay`, `razorpay-payout-webhook`, `paypal` deployed ACTIVE |
| Backend Deploy CI | run `40841237256` **success** — 103 live pentest checks, 40 escapes attempted, **0 failures** |
| KYC RPC in prod | `POST /rest/v1/rpc/refresh_light_kyc` as anon → 401 `42501 permission denied` (present, and not exposed to anon) |
| Premium tier seed | `20270209000000` raises if the canonical Pro row is missing, so a successful apply proves the Premium row exists and is active |

**One regression was caught by the live pentest and fixed, not waived.** The
light-KYC migration added four columns to `profiles` without extending the
14-column `authenticated` SELECT allowlist from `20270119000025`. PostgREST
expands `PATCH … RETURNING *` and the `profiles!fk(*)` embeds to every column, so
profile edits failed with 403/42501 ("own profile name still writable" 0/5).
`20270211000000_light_kyc_profile_grants.sql` grants exactly the four KYC
columns to `authenticated` (anon gets none), restates the security-detector
allowlist so the hourly drift sweep stays clean, and proves the boundary before
committing. A guard test now fails whenever any later migration adds a
`profiles` column without its grant.

**Still outstanding (founder action, not code):**
- SMS provider for the phone criterion (name + email verify today).
- `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_ACTIONS` stays `false` until that provider is live.
- Razorpay/PayPal live-key payment rehearsals remain untested (§4).
